## Kickstarter Data Analysis
This project was an analysis that I conducted on data procured from Kickstarter, with the primary aim of identifying which projects performed the best on this platform. The main focus of the analysis was to determine which project categories witnessed the highest level of activity. Alongside this, the analysis also involved investigating the project categories that had the highest probability of securing funding. The objective was not only to understand the trends within the Kickstarter community but also to identify the key factors that contribute to the success of a campaign.
